Put your custom notification scripts here. All executable files will be read in.
If you want your scripts to have user readable aliases then put those into
a comment into the second line, e.g.:

#!/usr/bin/foolang
# Notify via Loudspeaker
...

You script retrieves all necessary information about the actual notification
in environment variables beginning with NOTIFY_.
