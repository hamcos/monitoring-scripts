# Debug Notifications

# This notification script is just an example and shows how the
# script is being called:

# Check_MK will call this without an command line arguments.
# All information is passed in environment variables that begin
# with NOTIFY_.

# This debug script will fetch those variables and simply
# write them to the standard output. If you have enabled
# notification logging by setting notification_logging=1
# or notification_logging=2 in main.mk (or via WATO in the
# global settings: Notification -> Debug notifications, then
# you will see this output in the notification log file.
# Under OMD this file is in ~/var/log/notify.log.

# Please refer to the official documentation for more details.
